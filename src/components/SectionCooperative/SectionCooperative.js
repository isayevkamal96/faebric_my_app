            <p>We explore, work, share and learn in a cooperative of professionals. A cooperative is a flexible legal entity in the Dutch civil legislation. For us this means that we have a mix of different disciplines and expertise on board that work together on client projects in flexible constellations. </p>
            <p>Within the cooperative, there are three types of Faebriceers: Members (core of Faebric), Friends (close to Faebric) and Collaborators (collaborate on client projects). Members and friends also collaborate on client projects and additionally collaborate in a <span>token system</span> : By issuing tokens as representation of value we continue to craft Faebricâ€™s value system.</p>
